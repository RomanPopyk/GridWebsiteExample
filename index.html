            Manchester City have won the Premier League title for the third season in a row after Arsenal were defeated 1-0 by Nottingham Forest on Saturday evening.
            <br><br>It is the fifth time in the past six seasons that City have secured top spot under Pep Guardiola and is the first trophy of a potential treble, with the FA Cup final against Manchester United and the Champions League final against Internazionale to come next month.
            <br><br>In mid-January Arsenal had an eight-point lead over City but Guardiola's side have overhauled them with three games to spare. City have won their past 11 matches in the league while the Gunners have collected maximum points in just two of their past eight games. City have been ruthless since mid-February, a period which includes sweeping aside Arsenal home and away to increase the pressure on Mikel Arteta's side.</p></div>
